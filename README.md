# C-programs
A lot of simple programs in C

First program (sumOfDiagonals) -> to sum of diagonals that intersect in point A(x,y). Dynamic allocate memory 

Second program (sortStringArray) -> in this program you can enter 'n' strings to array and program will sort the table depending on the number of lowercase letters (I used bubble sort). The string can be 100 characters long.
